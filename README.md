# Zapier/Syncro Contacts API Script

This script allows you to create contacts under existing companies using Zapier. This is a bridge we made until they expose the contacts api via Zapier directly.

Just add it to a "Code by Zapier" step and make sure you provide these values:

first_name
last_name
company_id
email_address
